This document details my experience in developing and maintaining CGBS



Week 4:
    What is happening:
        Everyone seems to be enjoying suing CGBS.  Two users didn't pick last week,
        making it 6 people who are consistantly picking.
        
        It also became apperant that the UCONN vs Arkansas State game didn't exist at all.
        I think this was an error from when I plugged the game in.
        
    What is wrong:
        Season detail page is incredibly slow.  I think it can be improved by rewriting
            the model's method for getting the user's pick records.
        There are still issues with games that were imported being flat out wrong.
    
    What I can improve:
        The leaderboard looks horrible.   It should look nice, give some emphasis
        to the leader(s), and account for ties.

    What I did:
        I searched the django documentation to find what tools are available for
        database access optimization.  I .select_related() .prefetch_related()
        can be used in lines that involve queries to join related objects in said query.
        
        I have found that it's useful to implement the more complex db calling in
        the views, and it feels very clean and right to collect all data that
        you know for sure you will use at that top of the view's method.
